    #     continue with all of what are doing below except for the grubby command
    #        which shoud be changed to --update the default entry, rather than the ones with the
    #          given kernel version
  
    # It might also make sense for us to create a new grubby entry with fips mode, rather than
    # change the current one.
    #
    # We should (possibly?) also be setting the default kernel parameters in grubby.conf
    #
    # We should (possibly?) also be installing prelink, and then uninstalling it, to look for
    # and unprelink, and prelinked DSOs. Or we should find another way to test for the existance
    # of prelinked DSOs (there must be one, i just don't know what it is off the top of my head).
    #
    # We should build and use grubby, dracut, and sysctl modules (or similar) that work well in
    # --check mode.  There currently is no grubby or dracut modules, and the sysctl module does
    # not work well for crypto.fips_enabled in --check mode because of the read-only nature of
    # crypto.fips_enabled.
